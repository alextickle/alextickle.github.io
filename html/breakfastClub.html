          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>'Breakfast Club' was team Empty String's final group project. It is a React application with an Express and Postgres SQL backend. My classmates and I had been meeting for breakfast every Friday at different restaurants in the downtown area, and so we decided to build a web app that would organize breakfast meetups. At the moment there is a single group that anybody can join. Every week users can vote on one of two randomly generated restaurants pulled from the database, which is updated weekly by pinging the Yelp API. When logged in a user can view relevant info about each choice, vote, rsvp, and send view a list of attendees. There is also a message board where changes can be suggested as well as a protected admin route whereby the admin can make necessary changes to the upcoming event.</p>
          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>The single greatest challenge posed by this project was the difficulty of merging </p>
